=====================

lib manage system example
This example is a quick exercise (really very quick ,just in a day... ) to show how to make a manage system based on Apache Httped,PHP and MySQL.

For the time reason I did not use ajax or other tech to get better perform.So if you want to use this demo as a part of your project , I recommand you add the ajax function to get better perform.

Apache Httped ,PHP ,MySQL ,bootstrap and jQuery were used in this demo. Thanks to Apache,PHP and MySQL Community , and thanks to Twitter and Google and other Inc who have contributed to those open source projects who is this base of this demo.

Special thanks to Glyphicons for providing free icon to Bootstrap. And thanks for hmoe ACG for providing some picture as test picture.
